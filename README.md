# Pi-Helper

An iOS app to quickly disable or enable a locally hosted [Pi-Hole](http://pi-hole.net/) instance. This lets you temporarily disable Pi-Hole's blocking without adding a site permanently to the whitelist.

This app was forked from [wbrawner/Pi-Helper](https://github.com/wbrawner/Pi-Helper). Written with Swift and SwiftUI.
